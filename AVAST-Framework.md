# The AVAST Framework: Complete Guide

## Executive Summary

The AVAST Framework is a specialized threat modeling methodology designed specifically for AI-assisted software development. Unlike traditional security frameworks that treat all code equally, AVAST recognizes and addresses the unique vulnerability patterns introduced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation.

## Background and Motivation

### The AI Code Security Crisis

Recent studies reveal alarming statistics about AI-generated code:
- **45%** fail basic security tests (Veracode, 2025)
- **62%** contain formally verifiable vulnerabilities
- **72%** failure rate for Java applications
- **83%** of organizations use AI for production code

### Why Traditional Tools Fall Short

1. **Pattern Matching Limitations**: SAST/DAST tools produce overwhelming false positives without understanding AI generation context
2. **Missing Intent**: AI code lacks the security reasoning human developers apply
3. **Training Data Poisoning**: Models trained on vulnerable code perpetuate security anti-patterns
4. **Iteration Paradox**: Each AI refinement often introduces new vulnerabilities

## Core Principles

### 1. Context Over Scanning
Traditional tools identify symptoms; AVAST addresses root causes by providing security context before generation.

### 2. Proactive Over Reactive
Security requirements embedded in prompts prevent vulnerabilities rather than finding them post-generation.

### 3. Developer-Centric Design
Security measures that don't disrupt developer flow, making secure coding the path of least resistance.

### 4. Measurable Impact
Every control must demonstrate quantifiable security improvement.

## The AVAST Components

### 🔐 Authentication
**Focus**: Identity verification, session management, and access control

**Common AI Failures**:
- Hardcoded credentials in examples
- Weak password policies
- Session fixation vulnerabilities
- Missing MFA implementation
- Improper session timeout handling

**AVAST Controls**:
```yaml
authentication:
  requirements:
    - Use bcrypt/argon2 for password hashing
    - Implement session regeneration on login
    - Rate limit authentication attempts
    - Never log credentials
    - Implement secure password reset flow

  forbidden_patterns:
    - Hardcoded credentials
    - MD5/SHA1 for passwords
    - Predictable session tokens
    - GET requests for authentication
```

### ✅ Validation
**Focus**: Input sanitization, data validation, and output encoding

**Common AI Failures**:
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS through improper encoding
- Command injection
- Path traversal
- Buffer overflows
- Regex DoS

**AVAST Controls**:
```yaml
validation:
  requirements:
    - Parameterized queries only
    - Whitelist input validation
    - Context-aware output encoding
    - Length and type validation
    - Sanitize file uploads

  forbidden_patterns:
    - String concatenation for queries
    - Direct HTML rendering of user input
    - eval() or equivalent functions
    - Unrestricted file operations
```

### 📊 Auditing
**Focus**: Logging, monitoring, and forensics capabilities

**Common AI Failures**:
- Logging sensitive data (passwords, PII, tokens)
- Insufficient security event logging
- Missing correlation IDs
- No log integrity protection
- Verbose error messages to users

**AVAST Controls**:
```yaml
auditing:
  requirements:
    - Log security events (auth, authz, validation)
    - Implement correlation IDs
    - Sanitize logs of sensitive data
    - Rate limit log generation
    - Separate security and debug logs

  forbidden_patterns:
    - Logging passwords or tokens
    - User-facing stack traces
    - Unstructured log formats
    - Missing timestamps
```

### 🔑 Secrets
**Focus**: Credential management, encryption, and key storage

**Common AI Failures**:
- Hardcoded API keys
- Secrets in comments
- Plaintext storage
- Weak encryption algorithms
- Keys in version control

**AVAST Controls**:
```yaml
secrets:
  requirements:
    - Environment variables for secrets
    - Encryption at rest for sensitive data
    - Secure key rotation mechanism
    - Use vetted crypto libraries
    - Implement secret scanning

  forbidden_patterns:
    - Hardcoded secrets
    - Custom crypto implementations
    - Secrets in logs or errors
    - Weak algorithms (DES, MD5)
```

### 🛡️ Trust
**Focus**: Authorization, boundaries, and privilege management

**Common AI Failures**:
- Missing authorization checks
- Client-side security controls
- Privilege escalation paths
- Insecure direct object references
- Trust boundary violations

**AVAST Controls**:
```yaml
trust:
  requirements:
    - Server-side authorization for all operations
    - Principle of least privilege
    - Validate trust boundaries
    - Implement proper CORS policies
    - Use secure defaults

  forbidden_patterns:
    - Client-side authorization
    - Unrestricted admin functions
    - Missing boundary validation
    - Overly permissive CORS
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment (Days 1-5)
1. **Inventory AI Usage**
   ```bash
   # Find AI-assisted code

   git grep -l "AI-generated\|Generated by\|Copilot"
   ```

2. **Baseline Security Posture**

3. **Gap Analysis**
   - Map vulnerabilities to AVAST categories
   - Identify pattern clusters
   - Prioritize high-risk areas

### Phase 2: Integration (Days 6-15)

## Threat Modeling Process

### Step 1: Component Mapping
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Identify Components] --> B[Map Data Flows]
    B --> C[Identify threats with STRIDE]
    C --> D[Apply AVAST similarly to STRIDE]
    D --> E[Generate Threat Matrix]
```

### Step 2: Threat Identification

| Component | AVAST Category | Potential Threats | Risk Level |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| Login API | Authentication | Brute force, credential stuffing | High |
| User Input | Validation | SQL injection, XSS | Critical |
| Error Handler | Auditing | Information disclosure | Medium |
| Config Loader | Secrets | Hardcoded credentials | High |
| Admin Panel | Trust | Privilege escalation | Critical |

### Step 3: Mitigation Planning

For each identified threat:
1. Define specific security requirements
2. Create test cases
3. Implement controls
4. Verify effectiveness

## Metrics and Measurement

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Vulnerability Density**
   ```
   VD = Vulnerabilities / KLOC (pre-AVAST vs post-AVAST)
   Target: 50% reduction in 30 days
   ```

2. **Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR)**
   ```
   MTTR = Σ(Time to fix) / Number of issues
   Target: 40% improvement
   ```

3. **Security Debt Ratio**
   ```
   SDR = Security fix time / Development time
   Target: < 15%
   ```

## Conclusion

The AVAST Framework represents a paradigm shift in securing AI-generated code. By focusing on proactive threat modeling rather than reactive scanning, organizations can harness the productivity benefits of AI while maintaining robust security postures.

Remember: **Your AI doesn't know what it doesn't know about security. AVAST provides the context it needs.**
